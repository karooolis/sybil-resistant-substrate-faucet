Sybil-resistant faucet is a generic browser-based faucet solution that can be used on any existing parachain (substrate-based chain, either pallets or ink! smart contracts).

## Getting Started

1. Configure environment variables that are needed for user authentication, faucet wallet, etc. Copy `.env.sample` file into `.env.local` and `.env.test`, and start setting up the environment variables in both of these. The rationale behind different environments setup can be found in [Environments](#environments) section. Each variable, along with its setup instructions, as well as default values, is described in [Configuration](#configuration) section.

2. Install the dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. (optional) For local development and testing you may also want to set up a local Substrate node. Find instructions on [local blockchain setup](#local-blockchain-setup).

4. Once all environment variables are ready, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

**Note**: all environment variables need to be set correctly in order for the faucet to work ðŸš¨

## Testing

Tests consist of unit & integration tests for frontend & backend, as well as E2E tests.

### Unit & integration testing

Unit & integration tests are written in Jest. Frontend tests are run with:

```bash
npm run test:frontend
# or
yarn test:frontend
```

Backend tests are run with:

```bash
npm run test:backend
# or
yarn test:backend
```

### End-to-end testing

End-to-end tests are written in Playwright, and can be run with:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
# or
yarn test:e2e
```

**Note**: in order for E2E tests to work, all environment variables need to be configured.

## Configuration

To make the faucet generic, many of its parts are configurable. Configuration settings are stored in `.env` files, one per each environment. Read more about environments and their setup in [environments](#environments) section.

### Local blockchain setup

1. First, set up the local blockchain using instructions from [Substrate documentation](https://docs.substrate.io/quick-start/).
2. Run the local blockchain with `./target/release/node-template --dev`.
3. Obtain secret seed that is used as faucet's fund wallet by running ` ./target/release/node-template key inspect //Alice`.

### Environments

In order to avoid accidental sending of tokens, or other potential issues regarding account and network mismatches, there are 3 environments by default which need to be configured, test, development and production.

To get them set up, copy the sample file `.env.sample` and configure the variables for each environment separately:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
cp .env.sample .env.test
cp .env.sample .env.local
```

| Environment  | Description                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `.env`       | Used for production environment.      |
| `.env.test`  | Used for the testing environment.     |
| `.env.local` | Used for the development environment. |
